# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This book provides a complete learning path from fundamental ROS 2 concepts to advanced Vision-Language-Action systems for building AI-driven humanoid robots.

## Overview

This book is structured into four core modules that progressively build your understanding and skills in Physical AI:

### Module 1: ROS 2 (Robotic Nervous System)
- Core ROS 2 concepts: nodes, topics, services, actions
- Robot description with URDF and XACRO
- Launch files and parameter management
- Debugging and tooling

### Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Simulation environments and physics modeling
- Robot models in virtual worlds
- Sensor configuration and testing
- Validation in simulation

### Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
- Perception systems and computer vision
- Navigation and path planning with Nav2
- Manipulation and control
- Sim-to-real transfer techniques

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- Voice recognition and processing
- LLM integration for robot planning
- Task decomposition and execution
- Autonomous behaviors

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Computer science students and robotics learners
- Developers transitioning from digital AI to embodied robotics
- Instructors and lab designers implementing ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac, and VLA workflows

## Prerequisites

Before starting this book, you should have:
- Basic Python programming skills
- Understanding of fundamental mathematics (linear algebra, calculus)
- Familiarity with Linux command line (Ubuntu 22.04)
- Interest in robotics and AI concepts

## Hardware Requirements

For the complete experience, you'll need:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS system with RTX GPU
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installation
- Access to simulation environments (Gazebo, Isaac Sim)
- Optional: Physical robot platform (Unitree G1/Go2) for real-world validation

## Getting Started

Start with Module 1 to build a solid foundation in ROS 2 concepts, then progress through each module sequentially. The capstone project at the end integrates all concepts into a complete autonomous humanoid system.
