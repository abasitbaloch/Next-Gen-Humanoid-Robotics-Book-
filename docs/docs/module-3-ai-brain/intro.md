# Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Introduction

Welcome to Module 3, where you'll learn about NVIDIA Isaac tools for creating the AI "brain" of your humanoid robot. This module covers perception systems, navigation with Nav2, manipulation control, and sim-to-real transfer techniques using NVIDIA's powerful Isaac ecosystem.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim for robotics simulation
- Implement perception systems using Isaac ROS packages
- Configure and tune the Nav2 navigation stack for humanoid robots
- Create manipulation control systems for robotic arms
- Generate synthetic data for training perception models
- Execute sim-to-real transfer of learned behaviors

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Modules 1 and 2
- Access to an NVIDIA GPU (RTX series recommended)
- Basic understanding of computer vision and robotics
- Experience with ROS 2 concepts

## NVIDIA Isaac Ecosystem

The NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem includes several key components:

- **Isaac Sim**: High-fidelity simulation environment
- **Isaac ROS**: ROS 2 packages for perception and navigation
- **Isaac Navigation**: Advanced navigation capabilities
- **Isaac Manipulation**: Robotic manipulation tools
- **Isaac Sensors**: Advanced sensor simulation and processing

## Hardware Requirements

For this module, you'll need:
- NVIDIA RTX GPU (3060 or better recommended)
- CUDA-compatible GPU driver
- Isaac Sim compatible system
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following sections:
1. Perception Systems - Computer vision and sensor processing
2. Navigation Planning - Path planning and execution with Nav2
3. Manipulation Control - Arm and gripper control
4. Synthetic Data - Generating training data in simulation
5. Sim-to-Real Transfer - Moving from simulation to real hardware

## Integration with Previous Modules

This module builds upon the ROS 2 foundation from Module 1 and the simulation knowledge from Module 2. You'll integrate perception and navigation systems with your simulated robot to create intelligent behaviors.

## Next Steps
