# AI/Spec-Driven Technical Book Creation using Docusaurus, Spec-Kit Plus, and GitHub Pages Constitution

## Core Principles

### Specification-driven writing workflow
Specification-driven writing workflow (constitution → plan → spec → chapters); Technical accuracy across AI, software engineering, and related domains; Modular structure enabling iterative expansion and refinement

### Developer-centric clarity
Developer-centric clarity suitable for computer science students and practitioners; Consistency in terminology, formatting, and document architecture; Build-ready compatibility with Docusaurus, Markdown, and GitHub Pages deployment

### Technical accuracy and validation
All conceptual explanations must be validated using authoritative sources (documentation, academic papers, standards, or industry references); Code examples must be runnable, tested, and platform-consistent; Architectural diagrams must follow a unified diagramming style (Mermaid or D2 preferred)

### Publication-quality standards
Technical definitions must follow domain-accepted semantics; Writing style: concise, structured, publication-quality technical prose; Version control: each major chapter revision must be traceable in Git history

### Tooling compatibility
Citations: Markdown-friendly citation blocks where applicable; Tooling: All content must remain compatible with Spec-Kit Plus generation and Claude Code workflows

### Reproducible artifacts
All generated artifacts (plan, spec, chapters) must remain reproducible using the Spec-Kit Plus pipeline

## Content and Structure Constraints

Book format: Docusaurus v3 project structure; Output: GitHub Pages deployment via standard docs/ folder or gh-pages branch; Content format: Markdown (.md or .mdx); Minimum length: 4 modules, each containing 3–6 chapters; Each chapter must include: objectives, core content, diagrams (if relevant), examples, and review questions

## Development Workflow

Specification-driven writing workflow (constitution → plan → spec → chapters); Each chapter must include: objectives, core content, diagrams (if relevant), examples, and review questions

## Governance

Complete book scaffold generated and validated under Spec-Kit Plus; All modules internally consistent in narrative, terminology, and structure; Docusaurus site builds successfully without warnings or broken links; GitHub Pages deployment passes verification and renders correctly on web; Content meets publication-quality standards: accuracy, structure, and readability; Code samples and diagrams validated through testing or rendering checks
